Antibiotic resistance is a pressing global health issue resulting from bacteria's development and the misuse of antimicrobial substances, posing significant challenges to public health.

In bacterial infections, antibiotic resistance can lead to treatment failure and complications. Genes in the bacterial genome play a vital role in conferring drug resistance. Knowing the resistance potential of these genes can help assess a bacterial strain's susceptibility to a specific drug.

Our research aims to classify gene resistance levels to antibiotics. Existing databases provide partial information, and we'll use machine learning and deep learning tools in a supervised approach.

The unsupervised bicluster model, although successful in grouping bacteria, didn't contribute to our research goal. The supervised approach with an MLP network using Relu and sigmoid functions showed promise. We trained 114 models, each specific to a drug. However, the task's variation between training and testing posed challenges. The model's classification provides a probability value indicating gene resistance or sensitivity to the drug.
